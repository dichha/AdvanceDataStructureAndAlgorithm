# AdvanceDataStructureAndAlgorithm
programs made during the Advance Data Structure and Algorithm Class Fall 2014
My Professor name is Dr. Steve Hubbard. He is one of an awesome  CS professor I have had! It is one of a toughest undergraduate CS class but I enjoyed the class thoroughly. I did need to work a lot :)
