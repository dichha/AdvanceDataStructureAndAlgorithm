# AdvanceDataStructureAndAlgorithm
Programs written during the Advance Data Structure and Algorithm Class (Fall 2014)
My Professor name is Dr. Steve Hubbard. He is an awesome  CS professor! It is considered one of the toughest undergraduate CS class. I enjoyed the class thoroughly and I did need to work a lot :)
